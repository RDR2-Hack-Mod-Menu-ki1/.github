### Product Description

The ‚ÄúFrontier Phantom‚Äù mod menu drops a slick in-game overlay that lets you toggle cheats in real time. A single hotkey launches the UI; from there you can juice your health, auto-lasso rivals, or teleport to Saint Denis faster than a stagecoach on moonshine. The code bundles four core modules:

1. **Combat Core** ‚Äì aimbot, recoil killer, bullet-track visualizers.
2. **Eagle ESP** ‚Äì outlines players, animals, valuables through walls.
3. **Bankroll Boost** ‚Äì instant cash stacks, gold bar spawner, fence unlocker.
4. **World Wizard** ‚Äì weather switcher, time freeze, speed hack, teleport.

All toggles are hot-swappable, memory-clean, and re-skinable so your overlay fits any desktop theme.
